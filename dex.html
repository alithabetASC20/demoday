    <h3 id="ydes">Since 2016, Yemen, the poorest country in the Middle East and North African region, has been in the midst of a civil war. In 2017, Yemen was declared the world’s largest humanitarian disaster by the United Nations. According to the UN, “An estimated 80 percent of the population — 24 million people — require some form of humanitarian or protection assistance, including 14.3 million who are in acute need. Severity of needs is deepening, with the number of people in acute need a staggering 27 percent higher than last year. Two-thirds of all districts in the country are already pre-famine." Children sleep at night hungry, and to the sounds of gunshots and bombs. The charities listed will send food and needed supplies to the people Yemen.</h3>
