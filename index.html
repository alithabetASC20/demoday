           We, the creators of OneHeart, made it up to us to provide the people with what we believe to be the most important causes and the top charities that you, as a donor, can trust. We've all seen commercials and articles about charities "doing amazing work" when in reality they're using your money for the wrong reasons. We've done our very own research about each charity and we've unoficially partnered with Charity Watchdogs and Charity Navigator to bring you only the best of the best.
